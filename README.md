## Installation

## Usage

The user is presented with a welcome screen consisting of a background image and an "Unblock!" button.  Upon clicking the button, the user is directed to the prompt selection page.  The user can select and number of prompt choices, including: a random name; a random portrait; random adjectives; random nouns; a random story theme; and random story location images. 

If the user selects no options, a warning message will appear, directing them to make at least one choice. When the user makes the prompt selections and clicks the "Unblock!" button, the randomly generated and retrieved responses will populate the HTML page.

If the user clicks the "Save Prompt" button, the responses will be saved to local storage.
